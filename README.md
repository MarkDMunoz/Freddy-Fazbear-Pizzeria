# Freddy-Fazbear-Pizzeria
This was another option on a  Academic project that I decided to do for fun. The purpose of this is to present my work and i would not like anyone to fork the repository or claim the code as their own. Do not commit changes to the repository. The project prompt was:

For this project, you will use the data tables on the SQL server. One set is labeled beginning with “pizza” and the other set beginning with “telecom”. You are encouraged to use any other reputable data source you find relevant (and free), however: note that you MUST use the data in the SQL server. The project itself is open format, with the only direction being as follows:

Option 1: I am looking to open a pizza restaurant, what suggestions do you have for success? or Option 2: I am CEO of a telecom firm, what is causing the churn in our customer base?

Your task is to clean and perform analysis on this data to create a report detailing the opportunities for our firm. You will need to include charts and graphs as necessary to support your proposal. The project must therefore use SQL, Python, and some business intelligence tool (Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, Excel, PyPlot, etc). However, that is not to discourage you from using any other resources to present a suitable, polished report/presentation deck/dashboard. There is no explicit minimum, nor maximum, length to the report/presentation deck/dashboard.

Simply keep in mind that you must present enough context to the data to make your proposal clear while remembering that there are other proposals that I will be reading, so the report must also be concise. You will be more intimately familiar with the data, your task is to highlight the connections in the data that are relevant to our firm.

You, and your team, will present a 5 minute presentation, including a presentation slide deck. You will also submit all SQL queries, Python scripts, and Tableau/PowerBI/Excel files created in the process of performing your analysis. This is the opportunity to show off your hard work and your ability to connect information into meaningful and operational insights
